Hello Kitty wants to pick some peanuts for her favorite Mickey Mouse.\\
She came to a rectangular peanut field with grid-like roads (pictured below), entering from the northwest corner and exiting from the southeast corner.\\
At the intersection of each road in the field, there is a peanut seedling with several peanuts on it, and all the peanuts on it can be picked off after passing through a peanut seedling.\\
Hello Kitty can only go east or south, not west or north.\\
Ask Hello Kitty how many peanuts can be picked at most.\\

input
\begin{formal}
The first line is an integer T, representing how many sets of data there are.\\
Next is the T group of data.\\
The first line of each set of data is two integers, representing the number of rows R and the number of columns C of peanut seedlings.\\
The next R row of data in each group of data describes the situation of each row of peanut seedlings in sequence from north to south. There are C integers in each row of data, and the number M of peanuts on each peanut seedling in the row is described in order from west to east.\\
\end{formal}
output
\begin{formal}
For each set of input data, output a line containing the maximum number of peanuts that Hello Kitty can pick.
